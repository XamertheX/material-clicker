# Contributing
Hello! I am glad that you are interested in contributing to this project. Contributing means that you are helping with the development process, whether that is suggesting idea, or creating new content.
We are always looking for more people to work with us. But before you start creating an issue or working on a feature. You should read this.

## How to Contribute
If you want to make something youself, you should always open a GitHub issue letting us know what you want to work on, so you don't waste your time working on something we don't like and end up rejecting it.
Then you should fork the repo to your GitHub account and start developing. Once you are done, open a Pull Reuqest here explaining what you added, changed, removed, fixed or anything like that.

Contributing does not mean coding, also means bug reporting / play testing and feature requesting, as those are **ALWAYS** helpful.

## The Code of Conduct
You should also read the Code of Conduct (located in the same folder this file is in) which describes how you should act and behave here. If you don't feel like reading it, all it says is just don't harass or shame anyone here. Or even more shortly, just use common sense when talking and working with other people.
