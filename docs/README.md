## Goal
The original goal of this project was to use as many components from
[Material Design Components](https://material.io/develop/web/) as we could, starting with
this new version of the game, we will no longer be using those components and TypeScript,
and instead we will be using regular JavaScript, [React](https://reactjs.org/), and
[Material UI](https://material-ui.com). And instead of going for using all components, we want
to just create the best game possible using what he have available.
