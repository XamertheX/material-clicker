# Material Clicker
> A clicker game using Electron and Material UI.

## Play the Game
Unfortunately, the game has not been released yet, and still is in development. We plan to
have the first working version out before February 16th, 2019. The game will be 
distributed though GitHub releases, though you will not have to download a new version 
each time. This will be done automatically.

## Goal of this Project
The original goal of this project was to use as many components from 
[Material Design Components](https://material.io/develop/web/) as we could, starting with
this new version of the game, we will no longer be using TypeScript, and instead we will
be using [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com).
