# The Game
Material Clicker is a clicker game using Electron and Material UI. Development of Material
Clicker has started around early February. This was after the abandoning of the 
[Old Material Clicker](https://github.com/WeAreDevs/OldMaterialClicker/).

## Old Material Clicker vs. New Material Clicker
There a couple of key differences between the old Material Clicker and the new one. One of
them is TypeScript. We decided to move away from TypeScript in favor for regular
JavaScript with React. Reason being, it took a while for TypeScript to compile and build
in the development process.

Below is a table showing the key differences and frameworks  between games.
