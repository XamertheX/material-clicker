# Keyboard Shortcuts
There are multiple different keyboard shortcuts in the game to help you navigate and do
actions more quickly and efficiently.

## Game Shortcuts
- Move to the Next Tab: <kbd>&#8677;</kbd>
- Move the the Previous Tab: <kbd>&#8679;</kbd> + <kbd>&#8677;</kbd>

## Shop Shortcuts
- Move to the Next Shop Item: <kbd>&uarr;</kbd>
- Move to the Previous Shop Item: <kbd>&darr;</kbd>
- Buy the Selected Shop Item: <kbd>&#8629;</kbd>

> [!WARNING]
> The shop keyboard shortcuts have not been implemented yet!

Of course you have your standard shortcuts for your operating system like `Alt + F4` to 
close the game (or `Command + Q` if you are on literally anything else).
